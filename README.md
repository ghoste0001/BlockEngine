   ```

## How to Use
BlockEngine supports executing a Luau Script by passing it as command-line argument, and with a familiar scripting API, you can create parts and edit them in real time!
```luau
local part1 = Instance.new("Part")
part1.Color = Color3.new(1,0,0)
part1.Position = Vector3.new(0, 2.5, 0)
part1.Size = Vector3.one * 2
part1.Shape = "CornerWedge"

local part2 = Instance.new("Part")
part2.Color = Color3.new(1,0,0)
part2.Position = Vector3.new(3, 2.5, 0)
part2.Size = Vector3.one * 2
part2.Shape = "Wedge"

local t = 0
while true do
    t += task.wait()
    part1.Rotation = Vector3.new(0, t * 100, 0)
    part1.Color = Color3.fromHSV((t*0.2)%1, 1, 1)

    part2.Rotation = Vector3.new(0, t * 100, 0)
    part2.Color = Color3.fromHSV((t*0.2)%1, 1, 1)
end
```
